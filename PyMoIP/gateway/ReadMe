PyMoIP gateway
==============

Purpose :

  Basic
  -----
This program will accept connections from multiple remote users (clients) what are using WebSocket and/or Telnet protocol. Those client might be :
- A WS client (MiEdit) running from your browser (see www.teletel.org)
- A telnet client (iTimtel or any legacy emulator) running from your Windows PC
- A serial to WS bridge (PyMoIP user)

Once a user session is accepted, communication is routed to the default server with the proper parameters, as defined from the command line.

  Advanced
  --------
  
If the default videotext server is PyMoIP server running 'module_teletel.py', then the gateway is able to communicate smartly with the module
