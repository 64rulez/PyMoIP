PyMoIP gateway
==============

Usage :
-------
pi@raspberrypi:~/python/PyMoIP $ python3 -m Gateway --tcp 9000 --ws 9001
2021-06-05 01:21:41,519 [INFO] Launching a WebSocket Server on port '9001' and a TCP Server on port '9000'
Target server 'ws://localhost:8765' ping_interval=None subprotocols=[]
GatewayServer.py->_ws_connect_to_server_bis() trying connection to ws://localhost:8764.
2021-06-05 01:21:41,540 [ERROR] Gateway --Trying---- to connect to WS [ws://localhost:8764]
GatewayLink openned


Purpose :
---------
  Basic
  -----
This program will accept connections from multiple remote users (clients) what are using WebSocket and/or Telnet protocol. Those client might be :
- A WS client (MiEdit) running from your browser (see www.teletel.org)
- A telnet client (iTimtel or any legacy emulator using telnet) running from your PC
- A serial to WS bridge (PyMoIP user) allowing the usage of a real Minitel

Once a user session is accepted, communication from the client is routed to the default server with the proper parameters, as defined from the command line.
[Nb1 : Currently, only WS servers are reachable - it's planned to also reach telnet servers in the future]
[Nb2 : A 'server.log' file is maintained. Some cleanups to be done]

  Advanced
  --------
When the default videotext server is a PyMoIP_server running 'module_teletel.py', then the gateway is able to communicate smartly with the module. This adds :
- Allows PyMoIP_server to redirect communication of the client to another videotext server
- Allows PyMoIP_server to regain communication with the client once it is disconnected from the other videotext server - monitor Connexion/Fin key
- Allows PyMoIP_server to display the virtual cost of the communication
- Allows PyMoIP_server to know the real @IP of the client

Manages timeouts for user inactivity and maximal session duration.

Deep view of PyMoIP gateway<=>server operation
----------------------------------------------
1) Communication  : 
    - PyMoIP_gateway connects to PyMoIP_server on it's command port
    - When/if it fails, retries every 5 seconds
    - Any user arriving or leaving is advertised to PyMoIP_server on command port
2) Identification : 
    - PyMoIP_server sends ENQ-ROM to the client
    - PyMoIP_gateway intercepts the first ENQ-ROM
        - It replies 01/7f/7f/7f/04 to the server, followed by user session details (including user's real @IP)
        - It also forwards ENQ-ROM to the client
    - PyMoIP_server recognize the sequence 01/7f/7f/7f/04 as introducer of user session details
3) Redirection :
    - PyMoIP_server sends a 'CONNECT' command to PyMoIP_gateway with all necessary details on command channel
    - PyMoIP_gateway informs PyMoIP_server of the ongoing of the redirection (CONNECTING/CONNECTED/DISCONNECTED) on command channel
    - PyMoIP_gateway starts a new session to the redirected server
      - Enables communication from user to the redirected server and back
      - Continues communication from PyMoIP_server to user (allow display of virtual cost)
      - Block communication from user to PyMoIP_server 
      - Monitor Connexion/Fin key usage to force disconnection from the redirected server

Known bug (with MiEdit emulation) : User is fully disconnected if Connexion/Fin key is the first key pressed immediately after a redirection
