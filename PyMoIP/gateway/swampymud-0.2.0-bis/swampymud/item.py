'''
This module provides base classes for Items.
item.Item acts as a base class for all items. Besides providing a few
skeletal methods to help with serialization and user interaction, this
class is relatively straightforward.

item.Usable is an abstract class used for checking ItemClasses. A
developer may create a 'Usable' class by simply providing an 'on_use'
method.

item.Equippable is a subclass of Item that provides additional features,
including support for character.Command methods.
